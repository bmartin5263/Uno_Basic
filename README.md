# Uno Basic
Recreation of the classic Uno card game with modified rules, text-based graphics, and computer-controlled AI players. Created during my Sophomore year at DePaul university, my goals with this project was to create a text-based game in python that included colors, effects, intelligent computer players, and an attractive user-interface without the use of external modules.

## Getting Started
__Language Version:__ Python 3.5

__Usage:__ python3 app.py

'''python Uno Basic repository consists of the following files:'''

* app.py
* card.py
* computer_player.py
* deck.py
* game_settings.py
* hand.py
* match.py
* player.py

Uno Basic does not require the download of any third-party modules and only uses standard Python library modules.
